###CREATING A BORDER-LAYOUT
- A border layout is layout manager which allows components to be aligned in 5 regions.
- The North, South, West, East and Center regions.
- Each region can only contain one component.
- It seems like a limitation, but one can think of adding another container e.g. a JPanel which can extend other components in the specified region.
